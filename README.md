# BreathMetrics
### Version 1.1
### 6/29/2018

BreathMetrics is a Matlab toolbox for algorithmic extraction of the full set of features in human respiratory flow recordings. 

It is a matlab class with functions that serve three purposes:
1. Extracting features such as times of breath onsets, volumes of individual breaths, and pauses in breathing. 
2. Calculating summary statistics of breathing such as breathing rate, minute ventilation, and tidal volume. 
3. Visualizing these features in several ways including a GUI for manual inspection of individual feature estimations.


### BreathMetrics Accurately Estimates Features of Complex, Noisy, Human Respiratory Signals

The ability to algorithmically obtain the parameters of breathing in a raw recording is important for many reasons. Basic metrics, such as knowing whether a person is breathing or not, have obvious importance for health but accurately quantifying features like onsets, durations, and volumes of individual breaths is critical for research investigating the biology and neuroscience of breathing and olfaction. There are a multitude of features embedded in respiratory signals that are poorly understood and investigating them may reveal new insights about their biological underpinnings and how they correlate with disease.


Human breathing waveforms are surprisingly complex. Individuals regularly breathe at varying rates, with different individual breath volumes and waveforms, and may choose to pause their breathing for up to minutes at a time. These innate aspects of human respiratory signals make them difficult to analyze because they donâ€™t meet the assumptions made by most traditional automated digital signal processing analyses. In this way, other methods must be used to accurately extract the many important breathing characteristics hidden in respiratory signals. By developing an algorithm that accurately parameterizes human breathing recordings, we provide a much-needed computational tool for many facets of health research as well as olfactory and respiratory neuroscience. This method was rigorously validated using several methods on multiple datasets exhibiting a wide range of respiratory features. In this way, we hope this tool will allow researchers to ask new questions about how respiration relates to brain, body, and behavior.

## Usage
First clone this repository and append it to your Matlab path.

Instructions for using this toolbox (calculating specific features and accessing them) are described in demo.m

To reproduce the figures above, navigate to the breathmetrics directory and run:

```matlab
respiratoryData = load('sample_data.mat');
respiratoryTrace = respiratoryData.resp;
srate = respiratoryData.srate;
dataType = 'humanAirflow';
bm = breathmetrics(respiratoryTrace, srate, dataType);
bm.estimateAllFeatures();
fig = bm.plotCompositions('raw');
fig = bm.plotFeatures({'extrema','maxflow'});
fig = bm.plotCompositions('normalized');
fig = bm.plotCompositions('line');
bm.launchGUI();
```

## Dependencies:
Core functions of this toolbox are dependent on Matlab 2017b.

Only the instantaneus phase estimation function (which is not recommended) is dependent on the Matlab Signal Processing Toolbox.
GUI functionality is dependant on the GUI Layout Toolbox (uix) (Sampson & Tordoff, Matlab File Exchange 2014).

## This toolbox is maintained by the following people at the Human Neuroscience Lab at Northwestern University:
* Torben Noto
* Guangyu Zhou
* Christina Zelano

## Future Work
* In addition to human airflow recordings, preliminary data shows this toolbox can be used to estimate respiratory features in human breathing belt, rodent airflow, and rodent thermocouple recordings. These data are currently being validated.
* Improve GUI to allow editing of respiratory event estimations after manual inspection.
